Zul'Aman - Reinvented with World Editor
===
*My old Warcraft III World Editor project that pains in my ass.*

## System Requirements

- Windows NT
- Warcraft III TFT 1.30
- [JassHelper 0.A.2.B](http://www.wc3c.net/showthread.php?t=88142)

You can try other versions, but not tested.

Not compatible with version lower than 1.29 because of the item editing APIs.
Probably not compatible with version higher than 1.31.1 because of the lastest Lua feature.

## Build

1. Set system environment variables, include JassHelper and Warcraft III to PATH
2. ```make.bat```
3. ```run.bat```

## Map Information

**Category**：RPG  
**Players**：1-6
